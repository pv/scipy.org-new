# How to apply a FIR filter: convolve, fftconvolve, convolve1d or lfilter?
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# The following plot shows the time required to apply a finite impulse
# response (FIR) filter of varying length to a signal of length 131072
# using several different functions that are available in numpy and scipy.
# The details of how this figure was created are given below.

# The Details
# -----------
# 
# There are several functions in the numpy and scipy libraries that can be
# used to apply a [FIR
# filter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_impulse_response) to a
# signal. From scipy.signal, lfilter() is designed to apply a discrete
# [IIR filter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_impulse_response) to
# a signal, so by simply setting the array of denominator coefficients to
# [1.0], it can be used to apply a FIR filter. Applying a FIR filter is
# equivalent to a discrete
# [convolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution), so one can also
# use convolve() from numpy, convolve() or fftconvolve() from
# scipy.signal, or convolve1d() from scipy.ndimage. In this page, we
# demonstrate each of these functions, and we look at how the
# computational time varies when the data signal size is fixed and the FIR
# filter length is varied. We'll use a data signal length of 131072, which
# is 2\*\*17. We assume that we have *m* channels of data, so our input
# signal is an *m* by *n* array.
# 
# We assume our FIR filter coefficients are in a one-dimensional array
# *b*. The function numpy.convolve only accepts one-dimensional arrays, so
# we'll have to use a python loop over our input array to perform the
# convolution over all the channels. One way to do that is
# 
# <codecell>


    np.array([np.convolve(xi, b, mode='valid') for xi in x])

# <markdowncell>

# We use a list comprehension to loop over the rows of *x*, and pass the
# result to *np.array* to reassemble the filtered data into a
# two-dimensional array.
# 
# Both signal.convolve and signal.fftconvolve perform a two-dimensional
# convolution of two-dimensional arrays. To filter our *m* by *n* array
# with either of these functions, we shape our filter to be a
# two-dimensional array, with shape 1 by *len(b)*. The python code looks
# like this:
# 
# <codecell>


    y = convolve(x, b[np.newaxis, :], mode='valid')

# <markdowncell>

# where *x* is a numpy array with shape *(m, n)*, and *b* is the
# one-dimensional array of FIR filter coefficients. *b[np.newaxis, :]* is
# the two dimensional view of *b*, with shape 1 by *len(b)*. *y* is the
# filtered data; it includes only those terms for which the full
# convolution was computed, so it has shape *(m, n - len(b) + 1)*.
# 
# ndimage.convolve1d() is designed to do a convolution of a 1d array along
# the given axis of another n-dimensional array. It does not have the
# option mode='valid', so to extract the valid part of the result, we
# slice the result of the function:
# 
# <codecell>


    y = convolve1d(x, b)[:, (len(b)-1)//2 : -(len(b)//2)]

# <markdowncell>

# signal.lfilter is designed to filter one-dimensional data. It can take a
# two-dimensional array (or, in general, an n-dimensional array) and
# filter the data in any given axis. It can also be used for IIR filters,
# so in our case, we'll pass in [1.0] for the denominator coefficients. In
# python, this looks like:
# 
# <codecell>


    y = lfilter(b, [1.0], x)

# <markdowncell>

# To obtain exactly the same array as computed by convolve or fftconvolve
# (i.e. to get the equivalent of the 'valid' mode), we must discard the
# beginning of the array computed by lfilter. We can do this by slicing
# the array immediately after the call to filter:
# 
# <codecell>


    y = lfilter(b, [1.0], x)[:, len(b) - 1:]

# The following script computes and plots the results of applying a FIR
# filter to a 2 by 131072 array of data, with a series of FIR filters of
# increasing length.
