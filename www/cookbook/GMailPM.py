# Note to the administrators of scipy/cookbook
# ============================================
# 
# I'm planning to describe a method that could help other people to keep
# track of their simulations and provide simple framework. It is available
# as [pypi](http://pypi.python.org) package. A tutorial can be found
# [here](http://homepage.univie.ac.at/wolfgang.lechner/gmailpm.html). In
# the recipe I would just describe what I did in the python code.
# 
# Do you think this is appropriate here? The script does not make use of
# scipy or numpy but I think the audience of scipy.org might like the
# idea! Please let me know if this is an inappropriate recipe, otherwise I
# will just start writing next week.
# 
# Basics
# ======
# 
# The idea is to use python in combination with gmail as a powerful but
# yet simple tool to document runs of computer simulations, their
# parameters, starting times, progress and results.
