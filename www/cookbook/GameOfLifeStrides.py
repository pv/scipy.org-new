# Stride tricks for the Game of Life
# ==================================
# 
# This is similar to [:../SegmentAxis:Segment axis], but for 2D arrays
# with 2D windows.
# 
# The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British
# mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970, see [1].
# 
# It consists of a rectangular grid of cells which are either dead or
# alive, and a transition rule for updating the cells' state. To update
# each cell in the grid, the state of the 8 neighbouring cells needs to be
# examined, i.e. it would be desirable to have an easy way of accessing
# the 8 neighbours of all the cells at once without making unnecessary
# copies. The code snippet below shows how to use the devious stride
# tricks for that purpose.
