      "`* Size in pixels: e.g. 800x600 pixels`\\\n",
      "`* Dots per inch (dpi) e.g. 100 dpi`\n",

      "length units is irrelevant, the pixels are simply displayed. When\n",

      "`. 2) The layout of the figure is defined in 'figure units' so that as the figure size is changed, the layout (eg axes positions) will update.`\\\n",
      "`. 3) Size of text, width of lines, etc is defined in terms of length units (points?).`\\\n",
      "`. 4) When displaying to the screen, or creating an image (PNG) the pixel size of text and line widths, etc is  determined by the dpi setting, which is set by `\n",
      "`The trick here is that when printing, it's natural to think in terms of inches, but when creating an image (for a web page, for instance), it is natural to think in terms of pixel size. However, as of 0.84, pixel size can only be set directly in the GTK* back-ends, with the canvas.resize(w,h) method. (remember that you can only set two of the three size parameters, the third must be calculated from the other two).`\n",
